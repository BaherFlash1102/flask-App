# Flask + Redis Visitor Counter (Dockerized)

This is a simple web application built with **Flask** and **Redis**, fully containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**. The app counts the number of visitors using a Redis-backed counter and displays the result on a webpage.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask** â€“ Lightweight Python web framework
- **Redis** â€“ In-memory key-value store used as a counter
- **Docker** â€“ For containerizing the application
- **Docker Compose** â€“ To manage multi-container application
